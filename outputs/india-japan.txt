Here we have 30 independent songs, we use a significance level of 0.05, and a power of 0.8 for a single-sided comparision.
     approximate correlation power calculation (arctangh transformation) 

              n = 30
              r = 0.4386874
      sig.level = 0.05
          power = 0.8
    alternative = greater

Here we have 60 mean comparisons, we use a significance level of 0.05, and a power of 0.8 for a single-sided comparision.
